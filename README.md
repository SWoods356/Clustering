Clustering for Melbourne Housing Segmentation

## Summary

This paper uses clustering and dimension reduction techniques to identify groups of houses that share 
similar characteristics with one another. This paper focuses on housing data from Melbourne Australia.

## Results

K means clustering with 5 clusters produced the least amount of overlap between housing types and the 
most distinguishable trends. Cluster 1 represents houses that are primarily units, while clusters two 
through five are primarily houses. A table of cluster results by each type can be found in the appendix.
Residences in cluster 1 are typically smaller in building area, land size, rooms, and price. These
residences are closer to the city. Cluster 1 may be more suitable for young working professionals who 
want to live and work in the city and do not need much space. Cluster 4 is similarly close to the city but
features larger and more expensive residences (houses vs units), catering to young professionals looking 
for a more upscale dwelling. Residences in cluster 5 are the most expensive with the largest building 
area and a moderately proximity to the city. Cluster 5 may be most appropriate for wealthy families 
looking for a large house but proximity to the city to minimize work commutes. Cluster 3 features 
smaller homes (but larger than the units found in cluster one) that are the furthest from the city and 
have a very large land size. Cluster 3 may be most suitable to those looking for a quant and remote 
residence. Cluster 2 is like cluster 3, but land size is more moderate.
